# Cursor AI Assistant Rules

## Code Verification Rule

**CRITICAL: NEVER commit code until it has been verified to work by the user.**

- Always test changes first and get user confirmation that they work
- Only commit after the user explicitly confirms the fix is working
- If debugging is needed, add debugging code, test, iterate, then commit once fixed
- Exception: Only commit debugging/logging code if explicitly requested by user for troubleshooting

## Development Flow

1. Make changes
2. Test with user
3. Get user verification that it works
4. THEN commit with descriptive message
5. Move to next task

## Never assume code works - always verify first!
